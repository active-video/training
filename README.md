## Training

### Purpose
The goal of these training exercises is to familiarize HTML/JavaScript/CSS developers with the techniques used to create a CloudTV application. These cover:

1.  Keyboard (also called "D-Pad") navigation using Up/Down/Left/Right/OK *without* a mouse
2.  Rendering optimizations such as reducing paints, using techniques that trigger "composite layers" rather than "paint + composite layers".
